# api-sample
A small project practice, create REST API using `Golang` + `Postgres` + `Docker`.

I try to learn this architecture from [Trying Clean Architecure on Golang](https://hackernoon.com/golang-clean-archithecture-efd6d7c43047) .


## How To Run
- Install Docker
- Clone
- Run Command :
```
docker-compose up
```

## Accessing Swagger
You can access swagger by URL :
```
localhost:9000
```

## Accessing API
You can access API with BASE_URL :
```
localhost:8080
```

## Library
Library that I've used for coding
- [HttpRouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)
- [go-sqlmock](https://gopkg.in/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock.v1)
- [validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)
- [viper]("https://github.com/spf13/viper")
- [Go CORS Handler](https://github.com/rs/cors)
